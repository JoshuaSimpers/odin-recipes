        <h3>What You Will Need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds of fresh green beans, preferrably trimmed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 of a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <h4>How to Cook:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients and preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit or 200 degrees celsius.</li>
            <li>Rinse your green beans and pat them dry with paper towel. Then, spread them out onto a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle the beans with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.
                Toss the beans until they're all evenly coated and spread them out as a single layer on the baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Roast the beans in the oven until they are crisp-tender, look a little shriveled, and start to show browning or caramelized spots. This should take anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes so check often.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
