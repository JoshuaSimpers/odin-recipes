        <h2>The Dish</h2>
        <p>This will be a classic rotisserie chicken comprised of whole chicken, butter, and some basic seasoning. It's best to follow along with the recipe, but you're welcome to substitue the seasonings used for whatever you like.</p>
        <h3>The Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One 3-pound whole chicken</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 of a cup of butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat</li>
            <li>Season the cavity of the chicken with your pinch of salt. Tie the legs together and tie the wings to the body. Secure the chicken on a rotisserie attachment for your grill.</li>
            <li>Place the rotisserie over your grill and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is starting to cook, mix your melted butter, tablespoon of salt, paprika, and pepper together. Baste the chicken in the butter mixture while the grill is on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Close the lid of your grill and cook the chicken on medium heat, baste occasionally until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees fahrenheit or 83 degrees celsius. This should take 1 to 1 and a 1/2 hours to accomplish.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the rotisserie and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. Enjoy!</li>
