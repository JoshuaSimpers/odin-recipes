    <h2>What kind of cake will you be making?</h2>
    <p>The cake you will be making will be a Hershey chocolate cake. It will, of course, be a chocolate cake covered in chocolate buttercream frosting. The cake itself will be nice and moist and is perfect for any occasion.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients, or What You Will Need:</h3>
    <p>The cake and the frosting require different types of ingedients, so they will be listed separately. Here are the ingredients for the cake:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1/2 of a cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup of boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ingredients needed for the frosting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 of a cup of unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>5 and 1/3 cups of confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2/3 of a cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Directions, or How to Make The Cake and Frosting:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius. While your oven is heating up, grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Stir the dry ingredients: the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, in a bowl</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla to the dry mixture. Mix it all for roughly 3 minutes or until homogenous, then add in your boiling water and stir it too. Remember to be careful!</li>
        <li>Pour your batter into the two pans you greased and floured earlier</li>
        <li>Bake both pans in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cakes. Cool them for 10 minutes before removing them from the pans to let the cakes cool completely.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to make the frosting! Stir the unsalted butter with a mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add in your confectioners' sugar and cocoa with your milk and vanilla and beat it til smooth.</li>
        <li>Now that your frosting is complete, cut each cake in half horizontally. You should now have 4 equally-sized circular cakes.</li>
        <li>Now stack the 4 cakes on top of each other and add frosting in between each layer to act as an adhesive of sorts for the layers.</li>
        <li>Frost the outside of the cake with your remaining frosting. Congratulations! Your cake is now complete and ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>
